# FBI Forecasting - Crime Analysis and Time Series Forecasting

##  Project Name: **FBI Forecasting - Crime Analysis and Time Series Forecasting**

##  Project Type: **Time Series Forecasting, Predictive Modeling, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

---

## ðŸ“š **Project Summary**

This project focuses on **time series forecasting** of crime incidents using **FBI data**. The goal is to analyze historical crime data and create predictive models to forecast future crime trends, helping law enforcement agencies allocate resources more efficiently and develop targeted strategies for crime prevention.

The project involves multiple phases: performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns, cleaning and preparing the data, and using **ARIMA** and **SARIMA** models for crime rate predictions. Insights gained through this analysis will be used to assist in making **data-driven decisions** related to crime prevention.

##  **Problem Statement**

**Understand the crime trends from historical data and predict future crime incidents. By applying time series forecasting, predict crime patterns and help allocate resources to areas of high risk.**

---

##  **Business Objective**

- **Forecast Crime Trends:** Predict future crime incidents to allocate resources effectively.
- **Improve Crime Prevention Strategies:** Understand seasonal crime patterns and prepare strategies for high-risk periods.
- **Support Data-Driven Law Enforcement:** Assist law enforcement in making informed decisions for crime prevention and resource allocation.

---

##  **Tech Stack & Libraries Used**

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for visualizations)
- **Statsmodels** (for time series forecasting)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

##  **Dataset Information**

- **FBI Crime Dataset:** Contains historical data on FBI crime reports including crime types, locations, and yearly crime incident counts. The data has been used to predict future crime trends based on time series analysis.

---

##  **Key Findings Through Visualizations**

- **Crime Trends Over Time:** We observed fluctuating crime patterns over the years with peaks during certain months and years, revealing insights into **seasonal variations** and crime rate trends.
- **Seasonal Trends:** Some crime types exhibited higher rates during certain seasons, indicating a need for **seasonal resource allocation** for law enforcement.
- **Historical Crime Rate:** Certain years had significant spikes in crime rates, which require further investigation to understand underlying causes.

---

##  **Business Impact and Recommendations**

- **Targeted Crime Prevention:** Predicting crime spikes during specific times of the year can help law enforcement increase **patrols** and **interventions** during high-crime periods.
- **Resource Optimization:** Understanding future crime trends helps allocate resources more effectively, ensuring that crime-prone areas are better equipped to handle potential incidents.
- **Policy Improvements:** Insights from crime forecasts could be used to refine **policies** and **community outreach programs** for crime prevention.

##  **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the potential of **time series forecasting** in understanding **crime trends** and predicting future crime incidents. By combining **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with advanced forecasting techniques like **ARIMA** and **SARIMA**, this project offers practical solutions for improving **crime prevention strategies** and resource management in law enforcement agencies.

With these findings, law enforcement can proactively address crime trends and allocate resources more effectively, enhancing public safety.
